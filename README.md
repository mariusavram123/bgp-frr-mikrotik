# bgp-frr-mikrotik
BGP lab with frr on Almalinux 9 and a Mikrotik CHR

BGP is running on Almalinux 9 VMs - 5 of them in Virt-Manager on my laptop

Also I am using a mikrotik CHR router running on the same Virt-Manager

For now I only have added configuration dumps for all the devices in the topology.

Also added a mikrotik address list to block Microsoft telemetry by domain names
